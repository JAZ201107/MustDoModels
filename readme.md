In this repository, I'm going to implement some classic Deep Nerual Network Architecture and Building Blocks.

What is planning is:



* Architecture 

  - [x] [**Transformer** on Machine Translation](https://github.com/JAZ201107/MustDoModels/tree/main/Transformer-Machine-Translation):

  - [ ] [**Vision Transformer** on CIFAR-10: Image Classification](https://github.com/JAZ201107/MustDoModels/tree/main/ViT-Cifar10):

  - [ ] [**CLIP**](https://github.com/JAZ201107/MustDoModels/tree/main/CLIP): 

  - [ ] **Attention U-Net** on Medical Image Segmentation: 
  - [ ] mini-**BERT**:
  - [ ] mini-**GPT-2**:



* Tasks:
  - [ ] Image Caption:
