In this repository, I'm going to implement some classic Deep Nerual Network Architecture and Building Blocks.

What is planning is:



* Architecture 

  - [ ] **Transformer** on Machine Translation:

  - [ ] **Vision Transformer** on CIFAR-10: Image Classification:

  - [ ] **CLIP**: 

  - [ ] **Attention U-Net** on Medical Image Segmentation: 
  - [ ] mini-**BERT**:
  - [ ] mini-**GPT-2**:



* Tasks:
  - [ ] Image Caption:
